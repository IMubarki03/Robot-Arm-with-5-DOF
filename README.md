# Robotic Arm with 5 DOF



## Introduction
There are several Robot types, such as: _Humanoide Robot_, _Autonomous Robot_, _Drones_, and the last and most important is _Robotic Arms_. Robotic Arms are mechanical devices that resemble and function similarly to human arms, where it's importance exist when the work holds a significant risk on human. They are typically used in industrial automation and manufacturing, where they perform tasks such as:
- Assembly
- Welding
- Painting
- Packaging
- Material handling

  
## Parts Required
